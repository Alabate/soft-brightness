# Soft Brightness Gnome Shell Extension
## Overview

Soft Brightness uses an alpha overlay to control the brightness on all
or some of your monitors.  It integrates smoothly
Common uses are:

- Your laptop has no backlight, maybe because it's not supported, or
  you have an OLED display.

- You want to control the brightness level of external monitor like
  you do with your built-in screen.

Bonus features:

- Minimum brightness level: do not get lost in the dark.

- Can operate the shell in tear-free (VSync) mode at all time.

## Configuration

Soft Brightness comes with a configuration panel, which can be
accessed from the "Tweaks" application or the [Gnome Shell Extensions
page](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/).
